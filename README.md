This Project aims to take in characteristics given by the user and generates an image using an AI image generator API.

## Info
### JavaFX warning suppressions
Warnings were suppressed for the declaration of the FXML elements and the initialize method in the view controller classes (ex. `GeneratorViewController`). There were warnings
about the relevant elements and method that were saying that they weren't being utilized or assigned, even though they were in the background through JavaFX by rendering a fxml file.

### Entry Points
There is one entry point to our application, and that would be the `Application` class. It needs to be ran by the gradle menu in order for it to run properly.
